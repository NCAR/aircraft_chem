CONTRAST PICARRO processing notes
(for Lisa Kaser's version of the code)

matlab in-field processing:

Start matlab remotely from barolo
copy data files to barolo
matlab -nodisplay -r <scriptname without the .m>

load_picarro_data.m
- change research flight number, day of flight
- run and select *all* files (change path) from Private dir (HDF5 files)
- make RF09_PICARRO_data.mat

water should be under 0.1 if we are NOT in the boundary layer - if it's higher, we need to dry the desiccant.

contrast_read_netcdf_hires.m
- to read in CO data from .nc file Lou creates
- manually change RF number in several places
- manually change date
- run and select RF09 .nc file
- creates RF09_CO_data.mat

combine_CO_PICARRO_DATA_forRF09.m
- change RF #'s and dates
- run one chunk at a time, look at figures to make changes as you go
- writes RF09_forICARTT_data.mat

ICARTT_for_CONTRAST_2.m
- Uses Andy Weinheimer's data just to plot something in the end (can comment it out if you don't have it)
- change flight numbers and dates
- select RF09_forICARTT_data.mat
- Makes the final .ict file
- then go back in change pdf to fig to save .fig matlab files
