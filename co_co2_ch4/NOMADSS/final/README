There are some functions inside these which are in other files, but at the
moment I do not remember which they are.  These may also need the 3
toolboxes we purchase with our licenses: statistics, signal processing, and
mapping.  The nomadsIFPcoFinal.m file contains the main program, the
*FlightParameters.m file handles a big chunk of the flight specific
configurations.
